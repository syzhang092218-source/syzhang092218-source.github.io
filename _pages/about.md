  I am an undergraduate student in Tsien Excellence in Engineering Program (TEEP or Tsien class) at Tsinghua University, starting from Fall 2017. The goal of my research is to develop real intelligent assistive robots. My research interests lie at Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, Learning Algorithms including Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Transfer Learning.

Currently I am working with Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://www.yanansui.com/) and Prof. [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/) on Learning from Interactions. Previously, I have been working on learning from suboptimal demonstrations with Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://www.yanansui.com/) and Prof. [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/), developing clustering algorithms with Prof. [Hao Wu](https://haowu1983.github.io/), developing planning algorithms for autonomous driving with Prof. [Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://msc.berkeley.edu/people/tomizuka.html), as well as building medical robots with Prof. Gangtie Zheng.
