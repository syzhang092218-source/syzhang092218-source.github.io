  I am a first year graduate student at Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT. I received my B.E. degree at Tsien Excellence in Engineering Program (Tsien class, TEEP) at Tsinghua University in 2021. The goal of my research is to develop real intelligent assistive robots. My research interests lie at Robotics and reliable learning and control algorithms.

I am a member of [REALM](http://realm.mit.edu/) lab led by Professor [Chuchu Fan](https://chuchu.mit.edu/). Previously, I have been working on learning from suboptimal demonstrations with Prof. [Yanan Sui](https://www.yanansui.com/) and Prof. [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/), developing clustering algorithms with Prof. [Hao Wu](https://haowu1983.github.io/), developing planning algorithms for autonomous driving with Prof. [Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://msc.berkeley.edu/people/tomizuka.html), as well as building medical robots with Prof. Gangtie Zheng.
